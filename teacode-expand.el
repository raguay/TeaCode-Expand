;;; Commentary:

;; This code is used to expand the current line in TeaCode
;; program on the macOS machine.  It is currently the bare bones
;; in terms of functionality.

;; To add a hotkey for this function, add this line to your config
;; file:

;;     (global-set-key (kbd "A-C-e") 'teacode-expand)

;;; Code:

(require 'json)

(defcustom teacode-default-language "any language"
       "The default language to use when expanding a expression. Typically used when the buffer isn't attached to a file."
       :type 'string
       :require 'teacode-expand)

;;;###autoload
(defun teacode-expand ()
  "Expand the current line with TeaCode."
